The project was a smart car parking system allowing users to book online parking slots via a mobile app. 
My responsibility was to set up the cloud infrastructure and configure the gateway device (Raspberry Pi 3) to communicate with a Siemens PLC.
The gateway device was responsible for reading data from and writing data to the PLC. 
It then processed the data, packaged it into JSON format, and transmitted it to the cloud for further processing and analysis
